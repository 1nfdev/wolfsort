Intro

This document describes a stable adaptive hybrid radix / merge sort named wolfsort.

Why a hybrid?
------------------------
While merge sort is very fast at the adaptive sorting of ordered data, its inability to effectively partition is its greatest weakness. Radix sort on the other hand is unable to take advantage of pre-ordered data. Wolfsort tries to avoid the worst case of each algorithm.

Adaptive partitioning
---------------------
Wolfsort uses [quadsort](https://github.com/scandum/quadsort "quadsort") as its merge sort, which is very fast, except for purely random arrays, the adaptive partitioning processes has two primary functions.

1. Detecting whether the array is worth partitioning.
2. Partition in a way that is beneficial to quadsort.

Detecting whether the array is worth partitioning
-------------------------------------------------

The default hash table size for 32 bit integers is 256 buckets. Each 32 bit integer is
divided by 16777216. The maximum bucket size is 1/32nd of the array size.

If the maximum bucket size is reached the partitioning process is cancelled and quadsort
is ran instead. The maximum bucket size is reached in three cases: 

1. Many values are under 256, in which case all the values gather in the first bucket.
2. Many values are not random, in which case quadsort is likely to be faster.
3. Many values are repetitions, in which case partitioning is inefficient.

In all these cases quadsort is typically faster by itself while an aborted partitioning
does not notably hamper performance.

Partition in a way that is beneficial to merge sort
---------------------------------------------------
Because this approach is the equivalent of an in-place MSD Radix sort the 256 buckets are
in order once partitioning completes. The next step is to sort the content of each bucket,
and wolfsort will be finished.

Memory overhead
---------------
Wolfsort requires 8 times the array size in swap memory for the O(n) partitioning process.
The sorting process that follows requires 1/32nd the array size in swap memory.

If not enough memory is available wolfsort falls back on quadsort which requires 1/2 the array
size in swap memory. An important thing to note is that while quite a bit of memory is
allocated most of it will remain unused, it's there just in case it's needed.

Virtual quantum partitioning
----------------------------

While the memory overhead may seem like a bad thing, it can be considered a form of virtual quantum computing. Most modern systems have several gigabytes of memory that are not used and are just sitting idle. During the partitioning process the swap memory becomes akin to Schr√∂dinger's cat, it may be used, or it may not be used. Based on probability we know only 1/8th will be directly accessed, but because there is 7/8th to spare assumptions can be made that significantly reduce complexity and computations.

While more testing is needed it appears that in the 1K-100K element range wolfsort outperforms most sorting algorithms for random numbers, possibly turning spare memory into computing power.

Benchmark
---------
The following benchmark was on WSL gcc version 7.4.0 (Ubuntu 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04.1).
The source code was compiled using g++ -O3 -fpermissive bench.c.
Each test was ran 100 times and only the best run is reported.
