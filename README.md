Intro
-----

This document describes a stable adaptive hybrid radix / merge sort named wolfsort.

Why a hybrid?
------------------------
While merge sort is very fast at sorting ordered data, its inability to effectively partition is its greatest weakness. Radix sort on the other hand is unable to take advantage of sorted data. Wolfsort tries to avoid the worst case of each algorithm.

Adaptive partitioning
---------------------
Wolfsort uses [quadsort](https://github.com/scandum/quadsort "quadsort") as its merge sort, which is very fast, except for purely random arrays, the adaptive partitioning processes has two primary functions.

1. Detecting whether the array is worth partitioning.
2. Partition in a way that is beneficial to quadsort.

Detecting whether the array is worth partitioning
-------------------------------------------------

The default hash table size for 32 bit integers is 256 buckets. Each 32 bit integer is
divided by 16777216. The maximum bucket size is 1/32nd of the array size.

If the maximum bucket size is reached the partitioning process is cancelled and quadsort
is ran instead. The maximum bucket size is reached in three cases: 

1. Many values are under 256, in which case all the values gather in the first bucket.
2. Many values are not random, in which case quadsort is likely to be faster.
3. Many values are repetitions, in which case partitioning is inefficient.

In all these cases quadsort is typically faster by itself while an aborted partitioning
does not notably hamper performance.

Partition in a way that is beneficial to merge sort
---------------------------------------------------
Because this approach is the equivalent of an in-place MSD Radix sort the 256 buckets are
in order once partitioning completes. The next step is to sort the content of each bucket,
and wolfsort will be finished.

Memory overhead
---------------
Wolfsort requires 8 times the array size in swap memory for the O(n) partitioning process.
The sorting process that follows requires 1/32nd the array size in swap memory.

If not enough memory is available wolfsort falls back on quadsort which requires 1/2 the array
size in swap memory.

While the memory overhead may seem like a bad thing, it can be considered a form of virtual quantum computing.

In ideal conditions there is no computational difference between allocating and freeing 10 MB of memory and allocating and freeing 80 MB of memory. Historically software was always low on memory, and subsequently sorting algorithms were developed that bent over backwards in order to use as little additional memory as possible. Nowadays most modern systems have several gigabytes of memory that are not used and are just sitting idle. 

Instead of dynamically allocating memory as needed, or performing complex swap operations, or even more complex stable swap operations, wolfsort goes ahead and allocates enough memory to grow freely in any direction.

Normally if an implementation were to do this they would multiply the memory overhead by 256 times for 256 buckets. However, wolfsort is only looking to partition perfectly random distributions, and subsequently it can reduce the bucket size by 1/32th, and abort the partition process the moment a bucket becomes full.

During the partitioning process each bucket becomes akin to Schr√∂dinger's cat, it may be used almost fully, not at all, or somewhere in between. Based on probability we know exactly 1/8th will be actually used. The only overhead is to keep track of the size of each bucket, and to check that the bucket is not overflowing upon each addition.

Proof of concept
----------------

Wolfsort is primarily a proof of concept, currently it only supports unsigned 32 and 64 bit integers.

Memory allocation with malloc() is a bottleneck on many platforms. Using a custom memory allocator or permanent swap memory is a possible solution. 

Benchmark
---------
The following benchmark was on WSL gcc version 7.4.0 (Ubuntu 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04.1).
The source code was compiled using g++ -O3 -fpermissive bench.c.
Each test was ran 100 times and only the best run is reported.
